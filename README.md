`run_dictionary.js` is the main file.  

Program should be run with `node run_dictionary.js`.  

A prompt will then ask the user to input a phone number.  Small input edge cases are checked, ensuring only digits found on an official International Telecommunication Union's E.161 recommended touchtone dialpad are used.  Input can be no longer than 12 digits (ie 404-321-5454), no international calls!
